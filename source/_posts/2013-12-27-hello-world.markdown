Hey, there!

I built this site out of love for both the Rochester area and the Rochester
community.  We live in one of the most unique cities in the country, and our
amazing culture should be celebrated for what it is!

Right now, I'm building this site to be a bi-weekly, centralized, curated list
of cool and unique events occurring in the Rochester area.  If you or anyone
you know would like to advertise for an upcoming event, feel free to contact me
by email (dan "at" rochesterhappenings "dot" com) or using Twitter
([@roc_happenings](https://twitter.com/roc_happenings)).

Together, we can build a phenomenal site for a phenomenal city.  Thanks, and I
hope to see you again soon :)
